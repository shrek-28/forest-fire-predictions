# ðŸŒ² Forest Fire Area Regression

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project predicts the burned area of forest fires using meteorological and spatial data. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires). Various regression models are implemented, including:
+ Linear Regression
+ Polynomial Regression
+ Ridge Regression
+ Lasso Regression
+ Elastic Net Regression

## ðŸ“Š Actions Performed
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
+ Data Cleaning
+ Regression Model Implementation and Evaluation
